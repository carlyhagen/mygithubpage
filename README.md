#Imaginary Friends page

Images are in the /images/ directory. Name transparent pngs as (name).png. Art is (name)art.jpg. jpg is used for page optimization. It is suggested that images are no larger than 1000x1000.

The main two components of the webpage are index.html and /css/stylesheet.css. The rest of the css files are for bootstrapping and should work as is without modification. 

Things that need to be done: Ruby's art needs to be resized and uploaded. Maxwell's doing this later today.

Names need to be placed underneath the squares properly. Right now I've left it as if because it works well enough. However, as soon as you view the page on mobile the names move underneath each "row" of 3 portraits. This is due to a 'quick fix' that I did, with no real solution implemented as of yet.

I still need to clean up the code, too, but it should be clean enough for now. 

Make sure that if you work on the webpage that you test your edits in something like Firebug or Chrome's built in inspector before applying changes. This is totally against web design philosophy but we are pushing to production. This means that as soon as you make changes, they are live.

One issue is that webpages are often cached as they are being worked on. You may need to use ctrl+f5 in order to see changes you have recently made.
